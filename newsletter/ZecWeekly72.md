## Welcome to ZecWeekly Episode 72

It's been an awesome year as Zcash concludes its run with milestones of innovations, partnerships and worldwide adoption. Zcash ranks high in Crypto derivatives trading, Zashi Zcash Wallet upgrades, AMA session with Zooko and more!


#### This Week's Education Piece

Last week we held a community call with Ying Tong, the halo2 community manager. We learn about what halo is, why it provides better assurances for Zcash users and all about the various projects that use the proving system. Super interesting topics of discussion, definitely worth watching:
