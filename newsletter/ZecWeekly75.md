## Welcome to ZecWeekly 

Hi Community,

What a year of challenges! From sandblasting & regulation, to many of our teammates stepping away from the project. Despite these factors, because of the dedicated devs & avid community support we did surmount those obstacles.

The Zcash wallet user experience is massively improved. ZSA, ZavaX and FROST have made huge leaps toward ready products, we again seem to be in the spotlight of the crypto landscape. The future is bright!

I believe each of us learned important lessons we can take into next year. When it comes to dedication and ingenuity and collaboration, nobody does it better than us. We will win.

Happy New Year !!üéÜüéáüéâ
