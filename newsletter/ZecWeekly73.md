## Welcome to ZecWeekly 

Hi everyone, its been a while since i've written one of these! Eventful week, community members having lost some valuable NFT's, Zcash Foundation releasing the latest version of Zebra (PLEASE UPGRADE!) & the ZCG Candidates Call with some hugely important questions being asked to the team predominantly driving the direction of Zcash!

#### This Week's Education Piece

Today's education piece is a recent video posted by Hanh. Here he describes the challenges in maintaining adequete transaction privacy when transferring funds between pools. Each wallet 'builds' transactions differently and this will become important when finding solutions for exchanges to consider for Zcash deposits in future.
