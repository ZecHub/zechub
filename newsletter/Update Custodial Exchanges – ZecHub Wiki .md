-  **Shielded ZEC** refers to withdrawals sent directly to **z-addresses or Unified Addresses**, preserving on-chain privacy.
- All other custodial exchanges listed support **transparent ZEC only**.
- **Transparent ZEC** uses legacy transparent addresses and does **not** provide transaction privacy.
- Deposit times are approximate and may vary depending on network conditions.
- Custodial services may change ZEC support policies due to regulatory or compliance requirements.


## Recommendation

For maximum privacy, users are encouraged to withdraw ZEC to a **self-custodial wallet** and shield funds using wallets that support **Unified Addresses**.
