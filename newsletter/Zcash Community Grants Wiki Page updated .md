Proposal submissions are **open to everyone**.

The submission process has **three main stages**:

1. Prepare your proposal  
2. Submit it on GitHub  
3. Share it on the Zcash Community Forum for discussion  

After submission, the ZCG Committee reviews the proposal and decides whether to approve funding.
