# Image alt-text report

The image alt-text checker scans English Markdown pages under `site/` and
reports accessibility problems without failing CI.

It recognizes:

- Markdown images such as `![description](image.png)`
- Markdown reference images such as `![description][image-ref]`
- Inline HTML `<img>` tags, including multiline tags

It ignores fenced code blocks, inline code, and HTML comments so examples that
are not rendered as page images do not inflate the report.

## Run locally

From the repository root:

```bash
node scripts/check-image-alt-text.mjs
```

To write the machine-readable result as JSON:

```bash
node scripts/check-image-alt-text.mjs --json image-alt-report.json
```

To test the parser:

```bash
node scripts/check-image-alt-text.test.mjs
```

## Placeholder alt text

The configurable placeholder list is stored in
`scripts/image-alt-placeholders.json`.

To add another placeholder, append the normalized phrase to that JSON array. The
comparison is case-insensitive and collapses repeated whitespace. For example,
adding `"photo"` will flag `alt="PHOTO"` and `alt="  photo  "`.

A descriptive phrase containing a placeholder word is not flagged: for example,
`"ZecHub logo on a dark background"` does not equal the placeholder `"logo"`.

## CI behavior

`.github/workflows/image-alt-text-report.yml` runs the parser test and then
scans the complete `site/` corpus on relevant pull requests and on manual
dispatch.

The scan is intentionally **report-only**. Missing, empty, and placeholder alt
text appears in the job log but does not make the workflow fail. Operational
errors such as a malformed placeholder configuration still fail so a broken
checker cannot silently report success.
