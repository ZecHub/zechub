Downstream code forks should note that some (but not all) of these crates
and components depend on the 'orchard' crate, which is licensed under the
[Bootstrap Open Source License](https://github.com/zcash/orchard/blob/main/LICENSE-BOSL).
A license exception is provided allowing some derived works that are linked or
combined with the 'orchard' crate to be copied or distributed under the original
licenses (in this case MIT / Apache 2.0), provided that the included portions of
the 'orchard' code remain subject to BOSL.
See <https://github.com/zcash/orchard/blob/main/COPYING> for details of which
derived works can make use of this exception, and the `README.md` files in
subdirectories for which crates and components this applies to.

submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0
license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or
conditions.
