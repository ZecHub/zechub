If you wish to run the project please follow the instructions in gtn/README.md. You MUST run a zebra full node and lightwalletd to start the project. You can interact with the
relay node through the client found in gtn-client. I have already provided a .env file in the gtn/gtn-relay folder to get started quickly. If your zebra node and lightwalletd are configured
for different endpoints you will need to change the values in the .env file.
