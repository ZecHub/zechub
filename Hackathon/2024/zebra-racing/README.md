# Zebra Racing Game: ZecHub 2024 Hackathon

## Introduction
This project is a **Zebra Racing Game** that accepts and processes bets in **Zcash ($ZEC)**. The game is a proof of concept (PoC) created for the **ZecHub 2024 Hackathon**, demonstrating interoperability with Zcash through wallet connect features, fast payments, and bet processing directly from the blockchain.

## Zcash Interoperability

### Wallet Connect Feature
The game allows players to connect their **Zcash shielded wallet** in order to place bets. The process for connecting the wallet is as follows:

1. The player is prompted to input their **shielded Zcash address**.
2. The app sends a **verification transaction** to the provided address. This transaction includes a **unique verification code** in the memo field.
3. The player checks their wallet for the received memo and enters the verification code back in the game. Once verified, the wallet is considered connected.

### Bet Processing and Mempool Payments
- **Placing Bets**: Players can place bets by selecting their preferred zebra. Each bet transaction includes a memo field with a specially crafted JSON payload. The memo format helps the backend system process and verify the bet.
  
- **Fast Payments**: Payments are processed as soon as transactions enter the **mempool**, allowing for quick bets without waiting for full confirmations.

- **QR Code and Manual Entry**: Players can scan a **QR code** to quickly transfer the payment details to their wallet or manually enter the wallet address, amount, and memo details into their wallet application.

### Winning and Payments
When the race ends, the player selects the **winning zebra**. The game sends the payout to the playerâ€™s connected shielded address.

## Known Bugs

Please note that this project is a PoC and not intended for production use. Below are some known bugs and issues:

- **Zebra Animation**: Zebras can sometimes race past the edge of the screen due to timing issues.
- **Animation Frames**: Winning zebras may appear behind others if they are stuck in a "retracted" animation frame, even if they are technically in front.
- **No Refunds**: If the backend fails to parse the memo field correctly or if the bet is outside the valid range, there are no refunds.
- **Further Issues**: This is a proof of concept, so there may be additional bugs or limitations.

## Play at Your Own Risk
Given the bugs listed above and the PoC nature of this project, players should play at their own risk. There are no guarantees regarding payment accuracy, race fairness, or bet security.

## How to Build and Run this Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repositories
1. Clone this repository: [I'll add the link here]
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/james-katz/zebraracing.git
    ```
2. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd zebraracing
    ```
3. Clone the required dependency project (zingolib-wrapper) while inside the zebraracing directory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/james-katz/zingolib-wrapper.git
    ```

### Step 2: Build the zingolib-wrapper
1. Navigate into the zingolib-wrapper directory:
    ```bash
    cd zingolib-wrapper
    ```
2. zingolib-wrapper is experimental, use the `dev` brach:
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies and build the project:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
    > Note: Make sure you have Rust installed to build this project.

4. Return to the zebraracing directory:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
### Step 3: Build the Project (Frontend and Backend)

1. The project is split into two parts: the frontend and the backend.

#### Frontend
1. Navigate into the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install the frontend dependencies and build the website:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
3. Return to the zebraracing directory:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
#### Backend
1. Navigate into the server directory:
    ```
    cd server
    ```
2. Install the backend dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
---

### Running the Project
#### Frontend
1. You can host the frontend using an HTTP server or just run the following inside the frontend directory:
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
    > The app should be running at http://127.0.0.1:3000

#### Backend
1. To start the backend, navigate to the server directory and run:
    ```
    node index.js
    ```

Now the project should be running, and you can start interacting with it!
