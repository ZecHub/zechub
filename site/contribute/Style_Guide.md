# ZecHub Style Guide

ZecHub style is simple and approachable. We welcome everyone and focus on the Zcash community.

## Principles

1. **Ready to assist** - Demonstrate to Zcash users that we are on their side.

2. **Brief and to the point:**  Deliver the simplest message possible. Begin with the most important point.

3. **User-centered:** We write for users first, developers second, and everyone else third.

## Basics

- **Get to the point**. Start with the most important point. Front-load keywords for skimming. Make the user's options and next steps clear.

- **Write like you speak**. Our users are real people. Talk to them in writing.

- **Be brief**. Give users enough information for them to solve a problem or make a choice.

- **Skip periods in titles**. Remove the end punctuation on titles, headings, subheads, UI titles, and list items with three or fewer words. Periods are used in paragraphs and body copy.

  - Examples: Press the Send button->Press the Send button

- **When in doubt, avoid capitalization**. Only capitalize proper nouns or names like Zcash, as well as the first word of a heading or phrase.

  - Examples: How to Send ZEC with Unified Address. â†’ How to send ZEC with unified address

- **Rewrite weak writing**. Most of the time, begin each statement with a verb. You can and there were should be revised.

  - Examples: You can send and receive ZEC from your mobile phone->Send and receive ZEC with your phone

- **Don't be spacey**. Use only one space after periods and colons.

- **Avoid non-English words** such as de facto or ad hoc. Avoid latin abbreviations of common English phrases.
