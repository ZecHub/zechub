# Help Build ZecHub 

If you're a member of the Zcash community, and want to contribute building ZecHub, there a few things that are super helpful.

1. Curate links for the newsletter and add them to the newsletter's github page.
     * Find instructions on how to do that at [@ZecWeekly Newsletter](https://github.com/ZecHub/zechub/blob/main/newsletter/newslettertemplate.md).

3. Fact check the wiki docs, suggest edits, and propose new pages in Github (Please propose pages under existing sections. We don't want to overload the homepage of the wiki)

4. Create video content in the following categories:

    * Zcash explainer videos
    * Zcash wallet guide/tutorials
    * Third-party application demos


5. Produce designs such as posters/graphics/animations for Zcash & Privacy ecosystem 

6. Translate any of the existing wiki pages via ZecHub Global.
