# Contributing to ZecHub

ZecHub helps people learn about Zcash. If you're reading this page, we're really excited that you're considering contributing! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [zechub.wiki](https://www.zechub.wiki/) and other ZecHub social media.

### New contributors

To get an overview of ZecHub, read the [README](https://github.com/ZecHub/zechub/blob/main/README.md).


### Getting started

ZecHub uses GitHub to manage community contribution. If you're new to GitHub, don't worry! We're going to break down how you can get involved as a community contributor to ZecHub. We pay out tips in ZEC for accepted contribution. In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a pull request (PR), reviewing, and merging the PR.

### Join the conversation

First, join the conversation in our [community links](https://zechub.wiki/zcash-community/community-links).

### Style Guides

Any contribution to ZecHub should follow the [ZecHub style guides](https://github.com/ZecHub/zechub/blob/main/styles/guide.md). This includes wikis, docs and social media contents.

### Ways you can contribute

ZecHub is a community-driven project that aims to provide support and resources for Zcash users and developers. There are many ways to get involved with ZecHub, including writing for our weekly newsletter, contributing to our knowledge base, or helping out with development projects.

These are the types of contribution that ZecHub currently accepts:

#### Dev Work - 0.12 up to 0.5 ZEC per approved PR

Any approved dev work that helps build the Zcash ecoystem. This can include our wiki, new wallets, or any application you can think of.

#### Zcash Tutorials (video) - up to 0.15 ZEC per tutorial

Here is an example tutorial below:

Create and share tutorials on Zcash apps and get rewarded. Submit PR to zechub/tutorials or send video to #video-content channel in Discord. If video meets our criteria, we will post it and tip you.

#### ZecHub Wiki - up to 0.08 ZEC per new wiki page published

Our wiki site provides Zcash education materials in an easy and digestible format. Zcash is a very advanced technology with a vibrant community, so there's still more documentation we need to build. Our goal is to build documentation on:

```markdown
- Zcash and its related technologies
- ZEC (Zcash currency) Use cases
- New User Guides
- Zcash Community and Ecosystem
- Privacy Ecosystem & Tools
```

These are pretty broad areas, so there's a lot to work from. If you want some inspiration, check out our current [wiki-docs site](https://zechub.wiki/) and see what's missing. Once you determine what you want to write, [start to make your changes](#make-changes) and learn how to submit a PR to the ZecHub repo. All of our docs are created and maintained in this repo. Use the [docs template](https://github.com/ZecHub/zechub/blob/main/template.md) and follow the [ZecHub style](https://zechub.wiki/contribute/style-guide) when writing a wiki page.

After you submit a PR, please message @dismad or @tokidoki in the #zecwiki section of the discord, and they will review your PR and merge if it is ready to be added to the site. If merged, they will add the doc to the ZecHub website. If the doc is not ready, they will suggest edits for you in the PR.

#### ZecHub Wiki - 0.015 ZEC per accepted edit to docs

Sometimes our information in the docs isn't spot on. That's okay. That's why we open-source them! If you find something that needs a change in a wiki-doc, please go to the footer of the doc (which links to its Github page) and suggest a change via a PR.

#### ZecHub Wiki - 0.005 ZEC per broken link fixed

If you find that a link is broken, or something important is mispelled, please go to the footer of the doc (which links to its Github page) and suggest the change via a PR.

#### Newsletter - 0.05 ZEC per edition

We produce the ecosystem's weekly newsletter. This is a super low lift / easy way to get involved! The newsletter goes out every Friday or Saturday. If you want to write a newsletter, message @squirrel or @tokidoki in the #zecweekly section of the Discord to let them know.

After you do that, you can go to the [newsletter section of this repository](/newsletter/newsletterbasics.md) and submit a pull request to create a new edition of the newsletter. Please follow the format used in this [template](/newsletter/newslettertemplate.md).

After you do this @squirrel or @tokidoki (in Discord) will see that your new edition of the newsletter available, and they'll review and then merge it to the repository. After it's been merged, they'll take the content and post it via Substack.


#### Podcast - .25 ZEC per episode posted on ZecHub socials

Do you have an idea for a news show, podcast, Twitter talk, or other video/audio thing? Tell us in Discord #video-content and we will talk.

Rewards for this type of content are a bit larger, so a proposal would need to be submitted to ZecHub's DAO before approving the spend.


#### Other ideas? Let us know!

Have another suggestion? Tell us in #general on Discord. We can discuss it and see if ZecHub's DAO will support it.

### To Finish

Please do not hesitate to get started contributing to one of the industry's most respected protocols. This is a great way to get involved with Zcash. If you have any questions about contributing, please let us know on [Discord](#join-the-conversation).

Thanks!
