# ZecHub Community Infrastructure Framework


### Community Infrastructure 

All nodes, lightwalletd instances and other infrastructure is freely accessible and exists to increase developer access to the Zcash network. This allows the ZecHub bounty program to cater to developers in a more free & streamlined alternative to individual tasks on [Dework](https://dework.zechub.org). 


## Application 

- Tag @ZecHubDAOMember in the #zechub channel in the Zcash Global Discord to request access. 

- We will add you to a channel where you can receive support and share updates. 

- https://discord.gg/zcash
