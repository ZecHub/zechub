# ZecHub DAO

![Governance](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f9c810c-61ae-47c1-b5e4-bd4265e60d7c_5259x1667.png)

The ZecHub DAO currently consists of:

* @squirrel
* @yoditar.zkp
* @gordonesroo
* @michae2xl
* @dismad
* @tokidoki
* @decentralistdan
* @RedNosedGnome
* @Mine
* @Edicksonjga
* @vito
* @ZcashRU
* @Tecnopapapi
* @chidi
* @aquietinvestor
* @Olek


The DAO will serve as an experiment for future Zcash organizations who are interested in new forms of decentralized governance models, and ZEC’s utility cross-chain.


## What is a DAO

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.

DAOs need the following elements for being fully functional:

* A set of rules to which will operate
* Funding like tokens that the organization can spend to reward certain activities to their members
* Provide voting rights for establishing the operation rules.
* A well and secure structure that allows every member to configure the organization.  

## What makes ZecHub unique?

ZecHub is one of the first public DAO's in Zcash's history. A unique aspect of the DAO is that its funds are held primarily in a Shielded Zcash address, compared to most DAO's that live on Ethereum. 

## Governance

All DAO proposals are public and can be viewed [here](https://vote.zechub.xyz). Anyone can create a proposal to vote on. In an effort to support community transparency, the ZecHubDAO will post all governance proposals in the Zcash Community Forum [ZecHub Governance thread](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zechub-governance-updates/43674).
