## Introduction to IPFS 

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer protocol and network designed to create a decentralized method of storing and sharing files. 

Unlike the traditional client-server model of the internet, IPFS allows users to share files directly with each other, rather than relying on a centralized server to store and distribute content. 

Files in IPFS are addressed using *content-addressing*, meaning each file is given a unique hash or CONTENT IDENTIFIER (CID) based on its content, and this hash is used to retrieve the file from the network.

When a user adds a file to IPFS, the file is broken up into small pieces called blocks, and each block is given a CID. These blocks are then stored on different nodes in the network, so that the file can be easily retrieved from multiple sources. 

This ensures redundancy and fault-tolerance while also making it difficult for any one node to become a single point of failure or control.

## Creating your Site 

For this example we are creating a simple website. 

[Example Site](https://squirrel.surf)


**Step 1:** If you are unfamiliar with web design write the main content for your website including Title, Main Body of text, with links to other pages/site & footers.

**Step 2:** Use a [HTML template!](https://nicepage.com/html-templates) Paste the text you have written accordingly. Optional to also create a .CSS stylesheet for your website. 

**Step 3:** Save your directory. All .html pages + images must be in the same Folder. 



## Setting up a Node

Download and install IPFS from the [Official website](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/).



### Initialize IPFS: 

If you're using the Desktop Application you will not have to initialize. 

Using a Terminal or command prompt, Run command: <mark>ipfs init </mark>. 



**Add Site Folder to IPFS**: 

Select the folder with your website files and navigate to the Add Folder option.

--

If using Terminal, Run command: <mark>ipfs add -r "folder_name"</mark> to add the entire folder recursively to IPFS.


### Pin Site on IPFS: 

Once your website files are added to IPFS, you need to **pin** them to ensure they remain available on the network.

--

If using Terminal, Run command: If using Terminal, Run command: <mark>ipfs pin add "hash"</mark> 

"hash" = CID of the folder you added in the previous step.


Alternatively, you are also able to pin directories using services such as [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud) or [Dolpin](https://dolpin.io)

It saves a lot of time! 

--

### Access your website on IPFS: 

Your website is now published on IPFS and can be accessed using the hash of the folder. To access your website, you can visit https://ipfs.io/ipfs/"hash" 

"hash" = CID of the folder.

In our case the CID = "QmW2UEfap1vrRRvS5H9wed8qmsx4WsvXBk3GPGVVfWx3r3"


## IPNS 

Interplanetary Naming System (IPNS) allows you to update the IPFS CID's associated with your website and still serve a static link. It is provided as a key.

In the settings menu for your site foldre on IPFS desktop application select Publish to IPNS.  

![](https://i.ibb.co/Ch25dKf/IPNS.png)

Key: "k51qzi5uqu5di670a6uxywo17b2be1eyhoa2cl0qlwpfxn5p9ypcu8jbzgnj4n"

It can also be used to view our site via a gateway: https://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5di670a6uxywo17b2be1eyhoa2cl0qlwpfxn5p9ypcu8jbzgnj4n


## DNS Link 
 
The site has been created, now we need a way to point a URL to the content. 

If you already own a web address you are able to add a new record using the TXT record "_dnslink(your domain)". Depending on provider it may auto populate.

It will take time to propogate through the network before you can view it. 

Congratulations! You have set up a censorship resistant website.
