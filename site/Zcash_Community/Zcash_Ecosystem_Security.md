Here is where you will find updates on the [Zcash Ecosystem Security grant](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-ecosystem-security-lead/42090) project!

## Stay up to date!

This page serves as an overview of the Zcash ecosystem from a security auditor’s point of view. It lists all of the projects that are intended to fall under
the scope of the ZecSec project, as well as past audit reports, notable security bugs, and open security/privacy challenges in the Zcash ecosystem. You can
think of this page as “a security auditor’s guide to Zcash.”
