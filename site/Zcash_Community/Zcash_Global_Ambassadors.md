# Zcash Global Ambassadors


The Global Ambassador Program is designed to identify community members who make high-quality contributions to the Zcash community and empower them to become leaders. Ambassadors lead activities that grow the Zcash community, drive user adoption, and advance awareness of Zcashâ€™s privacy-preserving technology.

## What does an Ambassador do?

  * Hosting physical or virtual meetup events
  * Maintaining an active presence on social media, and creating original content related to Zcash.
  * Ambassadors have creative freedom over the activities they plan.
