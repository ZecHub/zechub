# Zcash Community Advisory Panel 

The Zcash Community Advisory Panel, or ZCAP, is a panel conformed by members of the Zcash Community, established as a means to involve the community and soliciting their advisory input whenever the Zcash Foundation needs to make a decision involving or afecting said community.

Since it's creation in 2018, the panel has helped define the way to go for the Zcash foundation in many important decisions, some of which include:

- [The Zcash Trademark](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/blob/master/2018-Q2/General-Measures/monetary-policy.md): This vote was about whether the Zcash Foundation should pursue a legal agreement with the Electric Coin Company (ECC) to share the ownership and control of the Zcash trademark
- [Monetary Policy](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/blob/master/2018-Q2/General-Measures/monetary-policy.md): This vote was about whether the Zcash Foundation should advocate for any changes to the Zcash monetary policy, such as the issuance rate, the halving schedule, or the inflation rate
- [ASIC Resistance](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/blob/master/2018-Q2/General-Measures/asicresistance_ballot.md): This vote was about whether the Zcash Foundation should prioritize ASIC resistance as a value and a goal for the Zcash network
- [The Zcash Community Grants Committee Election](https://zfnd.org/zcg-election-june-2023/): This vote was about selecting two members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, which is responsible for reviewing and funding grant proposals for Zcash-related projects
- [The Zcash Minor Grants Program](https://zfnd.org/launching-the-zcash-minor-grants-program/): This vote was about approving or rejecting grant applications for small-scale Zcash projects that applied for funding from the Zcash Foundation
- [Adoption and development of Zcash Shielded Assets](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/5dd57b92-01ed-11ec-a0a8-ae3066fac55d/view), which enables the use of DeFi generic assets within the private by default Zcash ecosystem.
- [Election of the Zcash Foundation Board of Directors members](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/960b8832-60f9-11ed-b96e-ee6991044d9e/view)

The idea behind ZCAP is that it is formed by a diverse group of community members with different nationalities, roles and opinions, to guarantee it remains comitted to its goal of representing the voice and interest of Zcash users and stake holders, while maintining an open and diverse network.

As of october of 2023, ZCAP is formed by [188 members](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-GbVFA1csIgPbvHOR-1ruOlh7YdA-CHvMtd6R8iSdY/edit#gid=0), and it is expanded frequently. Also, the Zcash Foundation has "expanded the eligibility criteria for ZCAP membership, including criteria that were suggested by members of the Zcash community".
