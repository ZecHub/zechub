# Cypherpunk Zero

Cypherpunk Zero is a story telling series centered around Zero, a young cypherpunk hacker and freedom fighter. Zero is currently living in a dystopian nightmare and she uses code to fight against the centralized gatekeepers shackling society.

The story was inspired by Zcash and Halo cryptography. The creative work is a collaborative effort between ECC, Stranger World, Might Jaxx and select ecosystem partners.

The creative work has most notably focused on an [NFT series](https://opensea.io/collection/cypherpunk-zero), but a [prologue comic](https://halo.electriccoin.co/#view-prologue) and [collectible toy](https://mightyjaxx.com/products/cypherpunk-zero) have also been released.

The NFT community, mostly active on Twitter, has even created a [decentralized organization (DAO)](https://twitter.com/CypherpunkDAO) to organize and complete projects supporting the campaign, and the broader Zcash community.

## Anti-roadmap Roadmap

We’ve seen too many projects over-promise and under-deliver on their NFT roadmaps. As such, there is no formal roadmap.

Trust that we’ve got some amazing, exclusive perks in the pipeline for NFT holders—some expected, some unexpected. Buckle up and join us for the ride.
