# Zcash Basics

## What are the economics of Zcash?

Zcash's monetary base is the same as the Bitcoin fixed supply of 21 million ZEC currency units. Every 75 seconds, a new [block](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/glossary.html#:~:text=Block,mempool%20in%20an%20unconfirmed%20state.) is mined to the Zcash blockchain and a block reward of 3.125 ZEC comes into circulation. This block reward is distributed to miners and the [Zcash development fund](https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014).

The amount of the block reward cuts in half about every four years until all 21 million ZEC are in circulation. Zcash inflation almost precisely mimics that of Bitcoin. It is important to note that as new coins are created inflation goes down, and at each halvening the rate drops significantly.
