# Zcash New User Guide

New to Zcash? This guide will walk you through getting onboarded as a Zcash user and *ZEC* holder.

**Buy ZEC**

To use the Zcash network, you will need to purchase its currency, *ZEC*.

The easiest way to acquire ZEC is to [buy it on Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/prices/zcash) or [any of these exchanges](https://zechub.wiki/using-zcash/non-custodial-exchanges).

One important note is that you do not need to buy 1 full *ZEC*.

*ZEC* is divisible, and you can start with buying just a fraction of the coin.

**Setup a wallet**

After you purchase some *ZEC*, you might want to move it to a Zcash wallet. 

This [article explains](https://www.ledger.com/academy/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-why-it-matters) why holding *ZEC* in a wallet is important. 

We recommend using a [shielded wallet](https://zechub.wiki/wallets) because these wallets provide the privacy features that make *ZEC* unique. 

Here's a video reviewing modern shieldeded wallets:
