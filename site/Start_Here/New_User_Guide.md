**Buy ZEC**

To use the Zcash network, you will need to purchase its currency, ZEC. The easiest way to acquire ZEC is to [buy it on Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/prices/zcash) or [any of these exchanges](https://z.cash/exchanges/).

One important note is that you do not need to buy 1 full ZEC. ZEC is divisible, and you can start with buying just a fraction of the coin.

**Setup a wallet**

After you purchase some ZEC, you might want to move it to a Zcash wallet. This [article explains](https://www.ledger.com/academy/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-why-it-matters) why holding ZEC in a wallet is important. 

We recommend using a [shielded wallet](/site/Using_Zcash/Wallets/Mobile_Wallets) because these wallets provide the [privacy features](https://www.gemini.com/prices/zcash) that make ZEC unique. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AefftLsENaU) on how to download a shielded walet. Here's a [blog](https://zechub.substack.com/p/private-vs-transparent) explaining the differences between Zcash's different wallet types.

**Withdraw ZEC**

After you create your wallet, your going to want to withdraw your ZEC into that wallet. Here's a [tutorial](https://twitter.com/decentralistdan/status/1508831570165121033) on how to do that.

**Send a shielded transaction**

After you've deposited some ZEC into your wallet, you're ready to send a fully shielded, private transaction. A shielded transaction is an exchange of ZEC that fully protects each participants privacy.

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WJSMxag2IQ) on how to do a shielded transaction.
