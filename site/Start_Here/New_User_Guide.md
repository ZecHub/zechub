# Zcash New User Guide

New to Zcash? This guide will walk you through getting onboarded as a Zcash user and `ZEC` holder.

---

**Buy ZEC**

To use the Zcash network, you will need to purchase its currency, `ZEC`.

The easiest way to acquire ZEC is to [buy it on Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/prices/zcash) or [any of these exchanges](https://z.cash/exchanges/).

One important note is that you do not need to buy 1 full `ZEC`.

`ZEC` is divisible, and you can start with buying just a fraction of the coin.

**Setup a wallet**

After you purchase some `ZEC`, you might want to move it to a Zcash wallet. 

This [article explains](https://www.ledger.com/academy/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-why-it-matters) why holding `ZEC` in a wallet is important. 

We recommend using a [shielded wallet](https://zechub.wiki/wallets) because these wallets provide the privacy features that make `ZEC` unique. 

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AefftLsENaU) on how to download a shielded wallet. 

Here's a [blog](https://zechub.substack.com/p/private-vs-transparent) explaining the differences between Zcash's different wallet types.

**Withdraw ZEC**

After you create your wallet, your going to want to withdraw your ZEC into that wallet. 

Here's a [tutorial](https://x.com/ZecHub/status/1823726880811528293) on how to do that.

**Send a shielded transaction**

After you've deposited some ZEC into your wallet, you're ready to send a fully shielded, private transaction. 

A shielded transaction is an exchange of ZEC that fully protects each participants privacy.

Here's some useful [tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEfQaYPV0UE) when using shielded ZEC.
