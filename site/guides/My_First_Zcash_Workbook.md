# My First Zcash Workbook

---

## Introduction

*My First Zcash* is an educational workbook created to help new learners, especially young people and beginners in crypto understand the fundamentals of Zcash, financial privacy, digital money, and the systems behind the technology. It was developed by a diverse and passionate group of contributors from across the global Zcash community, combining software development, design, research, education, and privacy advocacy.

This guide provides an overview of the workbook's core learning arc, divided into nine major sections. It is not a replacement for the book itself but rather, it is a companion resource that summarizes the educational flow and highlights important information for instructors, students, and community educators.

The workbook is freely available for download as a PDF or as an interactive flipbook:

## 1. What is Zcash?

This first section introduces readers to the idea of digital cash and why privacy matters in a modern digital society.  It compares traditional financial systems with transparent blockchains, highlighting how most public ledgers expose user activity.  Zcash is described as a privacy-preserving alternative digital money that allows users to exchange safely without revealing personal financial information.

 The workbook emphasises that privacy is not about hiding wrongdoing but protecting regular people from unwarranted exposure, surveillance, and data exploitation.  Learners are taken through straightforward examples that show how Zcash was created to give people genuine control over their financial lives and how regular financial transactions reveal more personal information than we realise.

## 2. Who Built Zcash and Why Does it Exist?

This section explains the origins of Zcash through the lens of scientific research and cryptography. It introduces zero-knowledge proofs specifically "zk-SNARKs" as the breakthrough technology that makes shielded private transactions possible.

The workbook also touches on the history of Zcash's launch, its founding principles, and the global community that maintains and supports the ecosystem today. The mission is framed around empowering individuals, providing censorship-resistant access to digital money, and advancing privacy technology for everyone.

## 3. How Zcash Works

This portion breaks down the technical foundations of the Zcash protocol in approachable language. Key concepts include:

- Transparent vs. shielded addresses  
- Viewing keys and controlled disclosure  
- The role of miners/validators  
- How zero-knowledge proofs validate transactions  
- How privacy is preserved even while ensuring the network remains decentralized and secure  

Diagrams and visual metaphors in the workbook help simplify these concepts for beginners.

## 4. Using Zcash in Everyday Life

Section four focusses on actual use examples. It shows how someone might send and receive Zcash using mobile wallets, how QR codes ease payments, and how users employ shielded transactions for personal protection, business confidentiality, or cross-border transfers.

Examples show real world situations including tipping artists, transferring money to relatives overseas, supporting NGOs anonymously, or utilising Zcash as a teen's private digital stipend.
