# Zcash Improvement Proposals

# What is ZIP
A Zcash Improvement Proposal (ZIP) is a design document providing information to the Zcash community, or describing a new feature for Zcash or its processes or environment. The ZIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend ZIPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Zcash. The Owner(s) of the ZIP (usually the authors(s)) are responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the ZIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

## ZIP Editors

For every ZIP that comes in, it must undergo the review process. ZIP editors are tasked with ensuring the format and content of any ZIP adequately describes terms, rationale and technical changes made.
