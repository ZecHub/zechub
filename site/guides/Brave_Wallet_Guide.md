## Address Types

Here’s an explanation for each Zcash address type:

**t-addr (t1...)** – Transparent addresses work like Bitcoin addresses, meaning transactions are public on the blockchain. They are easier to use with non-Zcash wallets but do not provide privacy.

**z-addr (zs...)** – Shielded addresses use Zcash’s privacy tech (Sprout/Sapling) to hide the sender, receiver, and amount. Only view keys or the owner can reveal details.

**UA (u... or QR)** – Unified Addresses combine multiple address types (transparent, shielded, Orchard) into one. This allows maximum compatibility while preferring privacy where possible.





## Conclusion: Privacy Made Practical

With Brave Wallet and shielded ZEC, privacy is now accessible to everyone — no special software or advanced knowledge needed.
