# How to Send and Receive Shielded Zcash (ZEC) with Brave Wallet: A Step-by-Step Privacy Guide

Brave Wallet is a secure, native crypto wallet built directly into the Brave browser - no extensions required.


## Why Shielded ZEC Support Matters


Zcash is one of the only cryptocurrencies offering privacy by default with shielded transactions.

Brave Wallet now supports Orchard shielded ZEC, enabling private transactions without third-party software.

Users can now send/receive ZEC without revealing balances or metadata - all within the Brave browser.

## Address Types

Here’s an explanation for each Zcash address type:

**t-addr (t1...)** - Transparent addresses work like Bitcoin addresses, meaning transactions are public on the blockchain. They are easier to use with non-Zcash wallets but do not provide privacy.

**z-addr (zs...)** - Shielded addresses use Zcash’s privacy tech (Sprout/Sapling) to hide the sender, receiver, and amount. Only view keys or the owner can reveal details.

**UA (u... or QR)** - Unified Addresses combine multiple address types (transparent, shielded, Orchard) into one. This allows maximum compatibility while preferring privacy where possible.
