# The Zcash Devtool

[What is the Zcash-Devtool?](https://github.com/zcash/zcash-devtool?tab=readme-ov-file) 

The Zcash Devtool is a platform for hacking on Zcash. It is built by developers, for developers, for testing & development of new Zcash functionality; and should not be considered production-ready. The command line API that this tool exposes can & will change at any time and without warning. DO NOT commit significant funds to the management of the zcash-devtool embedded wallet.

**Security Warnings:**
DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!!!
The app has not been written with security in mind. It does however have affordances such as encryption of the mnemonic seed phrases that should make it viable for small scale experimentation, at your own risk.
