## 4. Performing Multisig Transactions: Setting Up Distributed Key Generation (Multisig)

Multisig in Zkool uses **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)** to ensure multiple participants control a shared account.



### Step 1: Initiate DKG
Choose a **Name** for the shared wallet (eg Anabelle).

Set the **Number of Participants**.
  
Choose your **Participant ID**.
  
Define the **Number of Signers Required (Threshold)**.
    
Select the **Funding Account**.

### Step 2: Add Participant Addresses
- Enter each participants **Unified Address** (recommended).


⚠️ **Note:** If you use an Orchard only or Sapling only address, the multisig will be limited to that pool only (Orchard or Sapling).  
This means the shared wallet cannot receive funds from other pools.  
For maximum compatibility and flexibility, always use **Unified Addresses**.  


### Step 3: Run DKG Rounds
Wait for all participants to exchange **round 1** and **round 2** packages.

### Step 4: Finalize Shared Address
Once complete, a **shared address** is generated.
