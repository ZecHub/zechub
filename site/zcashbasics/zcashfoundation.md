# Zcash Foundation

## Mission Statement

The Zcash Foundation's mission is to be a public charity dedicated to building Internet payment and privacy infrastructure for the public good, primarily serving the users of the Zcash protocol and blockchain.


## People and Teams

The Zcash Foundation has nearly 15 employees that are distributed across the world. They work on various things such as protocol development, protocol security, business development and managing Zcash community events. 

The ZF team consists of a board of directors, the engineering team and an operations team, more info [here](https://zfnd.org/about/).

Zcash Foundation Grants provides the ecosystem with a means to fund projects that contribute to the privacy ecosystem such as Zebra (an independant node implementation for Zcash) & FROST. 

The Foundation also holds Zcon, a yearly in-person conference centered on the Zcash ecosystem and supports community initiatives such as the [Zcash Foundation A/V Club](https://discord.gg/WGEVenUq).


## Organizational Structure

The Zcash Foundation is a 501(c)(3) not for profit organization. In addition to their team, they have a board of directors.

## Funding

The Zcash Foundation receives 5% of the [Zcash development fund](https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014). Their use of finances can be seen in their [transparency reports](https://zfnd.org/the-zcash-foundations-q3-2022-report/) which they release every quarter.

## Zcash Minor Grants Program

On February 22, 2023, a new experimental credit program from the Zcash Foundation (ZF) was announced, which we call “Minor Grants”. It is intended to complement the Major Grants program (also known as Zcash Community Grants) by providing a source of funding for smaller grants. Hopefully, this will reduce the number of minor grant grants that are submitted to the ZCG, allowing them to focus their attention on larger, more controlled grants that are more in line with what the Major Grants program financially intends. Additionally, I would like to create a channel for subordinating titles that are not directly related to Zcash, but that explore broader applications of zero-knowledge proofs or other approaches to financial privacy, in line with our charitable purpose.

**The Application Process**

Applications should be submitted through the ZF concessions platform and applicants should agree to sign the ZF concession agreement and go through the ZF KYC process if the application is successful.

The deadline for submitting a grant application is 22 February 2023, 9:00 am UTC on Monday 20 March 2023.

**The Voting Process**

On April 17, we published the list of grant applications that will be submitted to ZCAP for approval.
