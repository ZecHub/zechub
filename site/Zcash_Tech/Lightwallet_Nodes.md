## Lightwalletd Service

The "lightwalletd" service, short for "lightwallet daemon," plays a critical role in Zcash's lightwallet node ecosystem. It acts as an intermediary that provides lightweight clients (lightwallets) with the information they need to function effectively. Here's a brief explainer of the lightwalletd service:

__Data Aggregator__: Lightwalletd aggregates data from the Zcash blockchain, such as transaction information, block data, and shielded pool information.

__Simplified Verification__: Lightwalletd performs simplified verification of this data, allowing lightwallets to access necessary information without having to validate the entire blockchain.

__Privacy Preservation__: The service maintains the privacy of Zcash users by not requiring them to expose their viewing keys or personal transaction information.

__Efficient Synchronization__: Lightwalletd enables efficient synchronization for lightwallets, significantly reducing the time and resources required to get up to date with the Zcash blockchain.

__Enter Server Information__: You will be prompted to enter the new server's address. Input the URL of the desired server from the current list or enter your personal lightwalletd server if you have one. 

__Save or Confirm__: Save the changes, and the application should now connect to the new server.

Remember to ensure that the new server is active and reliable to maintain seamless communication with the Zcash network.
