# Zingo 2.0 – Pepper Sync

## INTRODUCTION
Zingo 2.0 is the latest version of the Zingo! wallet, a lightweight, open-source wallet built for the Zcash community. The star of this release is Pepper Sync, a major upgrade that completely rethinks how wallets connect with the blockchain.  

In the past, syncing could feel painfully slow, error-prone, and resource heavy sometimes forcing users to restart from scratch. Pepper Sync changes all that. It makes syncing faster, smoother, more reliable, and less demanding on your device, while fully preserving the privacy of shielded transactions.  

Whether you’re a brand-new user testing Zcash for the first time, or a long-time community member managing multiple shielded wallets, Pepper Sync makes the experience far more practical and enjoyable.

## WHAT’S BETTER THAN BEFORE
