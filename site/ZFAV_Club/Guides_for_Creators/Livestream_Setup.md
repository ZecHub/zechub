# Livestream Setup

**What you will need:**

- Video camera with HDMI output without overlays
- Tripod
- HDMI-to-USB video capture device (2x)
- HDMI for capturing the presentation slides/demo (best if wireless)
- Audio feed from mixer (best if wireless)
- A laptop that can run OBS or similar software (best with ethernet)

*The purpose of this kit is quality and portability.*

There are ways to replace some of this equipment with more readily available solutions (like using a phone instead of a camera) which will be discussed in another wiki post.
