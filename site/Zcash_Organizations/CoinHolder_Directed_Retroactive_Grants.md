# Coinholder-Directed Retroactive Grants

The **Coinholder-Directed Retroactive Grants Program** funds completed work that has delivered verifiable value to the Zcash ecosystem.

It draws from the **Coinholder-Controlled Fund** (12% of block rewards + Deferred Dev Fund Lockbox seed), established by ZIP 1016 and activated in NU6.1 (November 2025). 

The program runs quarterly until the 3rd halving (~2028). Funds are held in multisig by Key-Holder Organizations (e.g., Shielded Labs, FPF).

---

Grants are **retroactive only** - rewarding past contributions (e.g., development, integrations, community building). Prospective work should apply to Zcash Community Grants (ZCG, 8% of rewards).
