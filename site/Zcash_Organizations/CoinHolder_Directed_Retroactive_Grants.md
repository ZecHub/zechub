# Coinholder Directed Retroactive Grants Program

## Overview

The Coinholder-Directed Retroactive Grants Program allows the Zcash community to fund work that has already been completed and can be publicly verified. Unlike traditional grants that fund future work, retroactive grants reward past contributions to the Zcash ecosystem. Coinholders decide which proposals receive funding through a democratic voting process.

## What Are Retroactive Grants?

Retroactive grants provide funding for:
- **Completed work** that has already been delivered
- **Publicly verifiable** contributions to the Zcash ecosystem
- Projects, individuals, or organizations that have made meaningful impact

You can submit a proposal for your own work or nominate others you believe deserve recognition and funding.

## Eligible Applications

### Who Can Apply?

- **Self-nominations**: Individuals or organizations can apply for funding for their own completed work
- **Third-party nominations**: Anyone can nominate another individual, company, or project they believe should receive funding

### What Types of Work Qualify?

Eligible work must be:
1. **Already completed** - No funding for future or ongoing work
2. **Publicly verifiable** - The work and its impact must be demonstrable
3. **Beneficial to Zcash** - Contributions should support the Zcash ecosystem, community, or mission

Examples of eligible work may include:
- Development contributions (code, tools, infrastructure)
- Community building and education efforts
- Research and documentation
- Privacy advocacy and adoption initiatives
- Design and user experience improvements
- Security audits or vulnerability disclosures

### Grant Funding Mechanism

As specified in [ZIP 1016](https://zips.z.cash/zip-1016), retroactive grants are funded from the **Coinholder-Controlled Fund**, which consists of:
- 12% of block subsidies allocated to a multisig-controlled fund
- Existing funds from the Deferred Dev Fund Lockbox

## Voting Process

### How Coinholder Voting Works

As outlined in ZIP 1016, the voting process operates as follows:

#### Voting Requirements
- **Minimum threshold**: 420,000 ZEC (2% of total eventual supply) must participate in the vote
- **Approval requirement**: Simple majority (>50%) of voting ZEC must vote in favor
- **Vote frequency**: Coinholder votes occur every three months

#### Voting Mechanics
1. Each coinholder can vote with their ZEC holdings
2. The same ZEC can be used to vote on multiple proposals (votes are independent)
3. No organizations or individuals are restricted from voting their coins
4. If multiple competing proposals exist, the approved proposal with the highest total ZEC support wins

#### What Coinholders Should Consider

When voting, coinholders should evaluate:
- **Technical merit** - Quality and significance of the completed work
- **Ecosystem value** - Impact on Zcash adoption, usability, or security
- **Feasibility assessment** - Whether the work aligns with Zcash values
- **Risks** - Any potential negative implications
- **Cost-effectiveness** - Whether the requested funding is appropriate for the work completed

### Grant Approval & Disbursement

- If a proposal passes the coinholder vote, funds are disbursed according to the grant terms
- Key-Holder Organizations (Bootstrap Project, Electric Coin Company, Zcash Foundation, Financial Privacy Foundation, and Shielded Labs) manage the multisig wallet and execute approved disbursements
- Grants can be **vetoed** in exceptional circumstances (see Veto Process below)

### Veto Process

A grant can be vetoed if:
1. Any Key-Holder Organization declares funding would violate legal or reporting obligations
2. Two or more Key-Holder Organizations object based on potential harm to Zcash users or conflict with community values

**Important**: Vetos are expected to be rare and must include thorough rationale. Key-Holder Organizations cannot veto coinholder rejection of a proposal.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I submit multiple proposals?
Yes, you can submit proposals for different completed projects.

### What if my proposal doesn't get funded?
Proposals that don't pass can be revised and resubmitted in future voting rounds, or you may apply for funding through Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) if appropriate.

### How much funding can I request?
There is no specified maximum, but your request should be proportional to the value and scope of your completed work. Coinholders will evaluate cost-effectiveness when voting.

### Do I need to have completed work recently?
The work should be relevant to the current Zcash ecosystem, but there's no strict time limit. However, more recent contributions may be more easily verified and valued by voters.

### Where can I ask questions?
Post questions in the [Call for Proposals thread](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/call-for-proposals-coinholder-directed-retroactive-grants-program/52107) on the Zcash Community Forum.
