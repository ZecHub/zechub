## Mission Statement

The Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) program funds independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem to perform major ongoing development and other work that serves the public good of the Zcash ecosystem.

## People and Teams

Zcash Community Grants is managed by a committee currently consisting of five members. This committee reviews and approves grant applications from third-party teams building on the Zcash protocol.  
Learn more about the committee on the [Team page](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/committee/).

Recent projects approved by ZCG include:

- **Zcash Shielded Assets (ZSA)** led by the QEDIT team, enabling DeFi functionality on Zcash through a new payments protocol with additional features for the Zcash mainnet.
- **Zcash Media Short Documentary**, featuring notable Zcash contributors such as Edward Snowden, Zooko, and Deirdre Connolly, created to deliver relevant, educational, and shareable content.
- **Ledger hardware wallet integration** by the Zondax team, enabling full support for Sapling shielded transactions for secure and private Zcash storage.
- **ZGo Point-of-Sale SDK**, a one-click shielded payment and point-of-sale system designed for brick-and-mortar merchants.
- **The Global Ambassador Program**, which expands Zcash’s international representation and supports in-person community events worldwide.

Several additional projects have been reviewed by the Zcash Community Grants Committee. View the [full list of submitted projects](https://zcashgrants.org/gallery/25215916-53ea-4041-a3b2-6d00c487917d).
