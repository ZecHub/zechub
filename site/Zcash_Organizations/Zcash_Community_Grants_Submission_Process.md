# Step-by-Step Guide: Submitting a Grant Application to Zcash Community Grants (ZCG)

_As of January 2026, Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) uses GitHub for formal grant submissions, with the Zcash Community Forum serving as the venue for public discussion and feedback. This process replaces the former Submittable platform._

Applicants must comply with ZCG terms, including conflict-of-interest disclosure, code of conduct adherence, and transparency requirements.
