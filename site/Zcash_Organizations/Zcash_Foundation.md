## Mission Statement

Our goal at ZF is to create tools that help sustain open networks, enabling anyone and everyone to protect their own privacy on their own terms. The essence of privacy itself is being able to choose what is or isn't shared with others. Privacy comprises both autonomy and consent; it is essential to human dignity and the healthy continuation of civil society.

## People and Teams

The Zcash Foundation has ~12 employees that are distributed across the world. They focus on protocol development, protocol security, protocol governance, infrastructure development and managing Zcash community events. The Zcash Foundation is not restricted to only working on Zcash and so also engages in developing privacy preserving technologies for [humanitarian aid](https://zfnd.org/zcash-foundation-launches-new-initiative-to-champion-privacy-preserving-humanitarian-aid/) and for the general public good.

Zcash Foundation Grants provides the ecosystem with a means to fund projects that contribute to the privacy ecosystem such as [Zebra](https://zebra.zfnd.org/) (an independant node implementation for Zcash) & [FROST](https://frost.zfnd.org/) as well as [various](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/08/tor-project-receives-670k-from-zcash-open-major-grants-for-coding-language-upgrade/) other projects through [Zcash Community Grants Committee](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/). 

The Foundation also holds [Zcon](https://zfnd.org/zcon/), a yearly in-person conference centered on the Zcash ecosystem and supports grassroots, community initiatives such as [Zcon Vozes](https://zfnd.org/zcon-voices/), regional specific [conferences](https://zfnd.org/zcash-dev-summits/), the Zcash Foundation A/V [Club](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/the-zero-knowledge-audiovisual-club/43733), now Zero Knowledge Audio Visual [Club](https://www.zkav.club/) and various other open community [calls](https://zfnd.org/arborist-calls/), community [events](https://zfnd.org/zf-events/#:~:text=Zcomm) and [AMA's](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/community-call-with-the-zcg-candidates-december-2024/49707).

The Zcash Foundation enforces the [Zcash Trademark policy](https://zfnd.org/new-zcash-trademark-policy/) per the updated conditions of it's donation by the Electric Coin Co. which helps "Protect the reputation of Zcash, its associated entities, and the Zcash community" by "identify(ing) official sources of information, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent or incorrect information" and "Identify(ing) official apps and services, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent activities." 

## Organizational Structure

The Zcash Foundation is a [501(c)(3)](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/820707962) tax-exempt, non-profit [charity](https://zfnd.org/#:~:text=Committed%20to%20Transparency). In addition to their [Team](https://zfnd.org/#:~:text=Our%20Team), they have a Board of [Directors](https://zfnd.org/#:~:text=Board%20of%20Directors) and facilitate community governance elections by polling the Zcash Community Advisory [Panel](https://zfnd.org/zcash-community-advisory-panel/).

## Funding

The Zcash Foundation no longer receives funding from the Zcash development [fund](https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014) as of November, 2024. Funding for The Foundation is now appropriated through traditional, tax-deductable [donations](https://www.jotform.com/form/251874383638065). Their use of finances can be seen in their quarterly [Transparency Reports](https://zfnd.org/category/transparency-reports/).
