Welcome to the “PGP* (Pretty Good Policy) for Crypto Podcast," an initiative of Electric Coin Co.!

We explore the intersection of blockchain technology, public policy, and global regulatory topics. Our goal is to provide our audience with in-depth insights and expert perspectives on the key issues shaping the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

You’ll hear interviews with industry leaders, government officials, and academics at the forefront of shaping the public policy environment for blockchain technology. Our guests will share their unique perspectives on the challenges and opportunities facing the industry and the impact of current and proposed regulations and policy approaches on the growth and development of the blockchain ecosystem.
