# INTRODUCTION

From a bird's-eye view, it is clear that social media has a lot more in the bag to unravel. Yes! Since its inception, it has been a force to be reckon ed with. This article is centered on "secure messengers." From Telegram to Whatsapp to imessage, these messengers are empowering connectivity across the world. Prior to the blockchain technology, the entire world was already used to web1.0 and web2.0 - Just so you know, there has been a sudden surge of interest in web3.0. In web3.0, we believe in decentralization - users will have control over their data and private keys.

## End-to-end encryption

Alright, let's reminisce! We know how daunting sending a message was in the early days; assume you want to send a secret letter to your friend but, you don't want anyone else to read it, not even the mailman that would deliver the message. That is where end-to-end encryption comes in - Simply put, End-to-end encryption is like locking the secret letter inside a magical box that only you and your friend have a private key for. Not even the mailman can have a peek at what the letter reads.

In view of the secure messengers, end-to-end encryption exists to be a security method that keeps a conversation secured. As messages travel from one device to another, no one, including the communication application you're sending the message from, and third parties won't be able to read eligible messages. Additionally, many groundbreaking and prominent messaging service providers like Facebook, Whatsapp, and Zoom are already leveraging end-to-end encryption technology. Over the past few years, some of these providers have faced controversy with regard to the decision to adopt E2EE. With end-to-end encryption technology, messaging service providers won't be able to disclose user information from their services to authorities and essentially provide private messaging to individuals involved in illicit activities.

## Reasons why E2EE is necessary?

For greater benefits, end-to-end encryption technology plays a pivotal role in situations where data security is necessary, including but not limited to finance, communication, and healthcare industries. It allows organizations to seamlessly comply with data privacy, security regulations as well as laws.

**Data Privacy**: With end-to-end encryption, it is said that only the intended recipient of a message or data can access and decrypt it. Meaning that even the messaging service provider, like Facebook and WhatsApp, cannot read the content. This immersive level of data privacy is important for users and organizations that don't want sensitive information to be disclosed, it could be financial transactions, business communications, or private chat sensitive from unauthorized access.

**Data Security**: This strong level of technology allows for the securing of data from potential breaches even while it's still in transit or at rest.
As data travels over servers or the internet, they are exposed to many factors that make it vulnerable to interception by unauthorized access, such as hackers. With end-to-end encryption technology, the data transmitted can be intercepted but, remains unreadable as long as the sender or recipient does not hold the encryption key. This would potentially reduce the level and data breaches whilst ensuring that individual and organization communications are kept safe.

**Trust and User Control**: With end-to-end encryption, individuals and organizations are empowered to communicate free because they know their messages, files, and other sensitive information are kept safe from unauthorized access. Equally, the technology helps to protect individuals and organizations against government outreach and surveillance.

### Some Popular Secure Messengers

**Zcash Encrypted Memos**

Zcash Desktop & Mobile wallets have an in-built feature that allows users to send encrypted messages with private shielded transactions. The memo/message size can be up to 512 bytes long per transactions with transaction fees being less than 1 US cent. Due to the privacy preserving way transactions are detected and the block time of the netwoek, messages may take up to 1 minute or more to be received.

On the Session app, users can create an account without phone numbers or email addresses which means it is completely anonymous. Users can send messages safely via their network without any trace so, there's nothing to leak.

## In Summary

End-to-End encryption is important because it fosters robust privacy protection, reinforces data security to its core, and enables users to hand full control over their own information as they travel over networks and devices, thereby addressing critical concerns in the digital age.
