# Secure Messengers

## End-to-end encryption

In view of the secure messengers, end-to-end encryption exists to be a security method that keeps a conversation secured. As messages travel from one device to another, no one, including the communication application you're sending the message from, and third parties won't be able to read eligible messages. Additionally, many groundbreaking and prominent messaging service providers like Facebook, Whatsapp, and Zoom are already leveraging end-to-end encryption technology. 

## Reasons why E2EE is necessary?

For greater benefits, end-to-end encryption technology plays a pivotal role in situations where data security is necessary, including but not limited to finance, communication, and healthcare industries. It allows organizations to seamlessly comply with data privacy, security regulations as well as laws.

**Data Privacy**: With end-to-end encryption, it is said that only the intended recipient of a message or data can access and decrypt it. Meaning that even the messaging service provider, like Facebook and WhatsApp, cannot read the content. This immersive level of data privacy is important for users and organizations that don't want sensitive information to be disclosed, it could be financial transactions, business communications, or private chat sensitive from unauthorized access.

**Data Security**: This strong level of technology allows for the securing of data from potential breaches even while it's still in transit or at rest.
As data travels over servers or the internet, they are exposed to many factors that make it vulnerable to interception by unauthorized access, such as hackers. With end-to-end encryption technology, the data transmitted can be intercepted but, remains unreadable as long as the sender or recipient does not hold the encryption key. This would potentially reduce the level and data breaches whilst ensuring that individual and organization communications are kept safe.

**Trust and User Control**: With end-to-end encryption, individuals and organizations are empowered to communicate free because they know their messages, files, and other sensitive information are kept safe from unauthorized access. Equally, the technology helps to protect individuals and organizations against government outreach and surveillance.

### Some Popular Secure Messengers
