# Web Browsers

1. **Brave:** One of the most prominent and safest browsers on the market today. It blocks privacy-invasive ads & trackers. It blocks third-party data storage. 

2. **Mulvad:** A privacy-focused web browser developed in collaboration between Mullvad VPN and the Tor Project. It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting

3. **Tor:** This browser blocks plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, QuickTime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. We do not recommend installing additional add-ons or plugins into Tor Browser


## What Are The Security Considerations When Selecting A Web Browser?

When selecting a web browser there are a few things to keep in mind: Security vulnerabilities and exploits are usually discovered regularly. Some browsers are traceable in some manner, but, there are browsers that allow users to browse anonymously - [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) for example. 

**Fingerprinting**: If you want to keep things private like, softwares installed on your machine, hardware configuration, and more, consider looking out for web browser that supports fingerprinting resistance feature. 

**HTTPS Test**: Another security consideration to look out for when selecting a web browser is the HTTPS Test protocol that helps to encrypt website connection and hides cookies, URLs and other types of sensitive metadata. With HTTPS, connection is encrypted and no third parties on the network can read content being transferred between the server and your browser. 

**Tracking Cookie Protection**: More so, a large portion of web pages in the world wide web has hidden third-party trackers; these trackers read and write cookies in your browser. These cookies can pose malicious treats because they can be used to track your browsing across websites; to prevent this tracking, select a web browser that blocks unknown browsing cookies.

**Navigation Test**: As you navigate from one web page to another, you will come across many links (some are internal links while others are linking to another website). As you click these links, certain browser APIs allow the first site to communicate with the second site. To resolve this, select a web browser that prevents websites from sharing tracking data when you click on a link. When selecting that browser that you feel might suit your need, make sure it provides robust privacy features and essential features such as built-in ad blockers and what not. Additionally, many of these web browsers support extensions plus add-ons and sometimes these extensions may pose security risks, be sure to always install these extensions from a secured ecosystem or trusted sources.
 
## Brave Browser Zcash Wallet Integration

Brave browser is paving the way for the web3 ecosystem. How? More than 2 million unstoppable domains can now be leveraged for displaying decentralized websites. With Brave Browsers robust security features, people can explore the internet without being tracked. Brave and Zcash are joining forces to bring new privacy tools to Web3 ecosysem. For greater benefits, Brave would integrate swiftly with Zcash protocol via Brave's built-in crypto wallet to revolutionize crypto transactions - This integration would enable users to safely store, send , and receive ZEC very easily plus other crypto currencies as well. The collaration between Brave web browser and Zcash would truly change the game as users will have greater control over their Web3 activiy. 

Another intriguing fact about the Brave browser and Zcash integration is the private and decentralized messaging feature; Brave, ECC, and the Filecoin Foundation team are paving a way for privacy-based feature in the Brave browser - this collaboration aims to offer private messages and media transmission via Zcash protocol. Here, Interplanetary File System (IPFS) will play an essential role in offering secure storage capability for the encrypted content.
