## **Best Practices**

**Keep the OS Up to Date** Regularly update GrapheneOS to ensure you have the latest security patches and enhancements.

**Use Strong Passwords** Set strong, unique passwords for device encryption and app logins to prevent unauthorized access.

**App Permissions** Review and manage app permissions carefully, granting only what is necessary for each app to function.

**Regular Backups** Perform regular backups of your data in case of device loss or data corruption.

**Encrypt Storage** If not enabled by default, encrypt your device storage to protect your data if the device is lost or stolen.

**Secure Lock Screen** Use a secure lock screen, such as a PIN, password, or biometric authentication, to prevent unauthorized access.

**Avoid Rooting Your Android Device** Avoid rooting or unlocking the bootloader, as this can weaken device security.

**Verify App Sources** Verify the authenticity of apps and their sources to avoid installing malicious software.

**Install a Privacy-Focused Browser** Consider using a privacy-focused browser like Brave browser, Firefox or Bromite for secure browsing.

**Regularly Audit Apps** Periodically review and uninstall apps that you no longer use or trust to reduce the attack surface.

**Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** Enable 2FA for your online accounts to add an extra layer of security.

**Avoid Public Wi-Fi** Be cautious when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, as they can be less secure. Use a VPN when necessary.

**Be Cautious with Location Data** Limit location tracking for apps and consider using a location spoofing tool if you value privacy.

**Avoid Unknown Links and Attachments** Be wary of unsolicited links and email attachments, as they could be phishing attempts or malware.

**Review Default Settings** Carefully review and adjust the default settings to align with your privacy preferences.

**Community Support** Engage with the GrapheneOS community and forums for tips, updates, and security advice. You can contact the team and stay updated clicking [here](https://grapheneos.org/contact) to explore more contacts.
