# Graphene OS

GrapheneOS is a non-profit, open-source project dedicated to enhancing privacy and security on mobile devices while maintaining compatibility with Android apps. This Operating system places a strong emphasis on advancing privacy and security technologies, with a particular focus on bolstering sandboxing, exploit mitigations, and refining the permission model. Born in 2014 under the moniker “CopperheadOS,” it has since evolved into the formidable guardian of your digital privacy and security.

GrapheneOS’s primary objective is to reinforce the security boundaries, such as the app sandbox, without adversely affecting the user experience. 

GrapheneOS may introduce various toggles for specific features, such as Network permissions, Sensors permissions, or restrictions when the device is locked (covering aspects like USB peripherals, camera access, and quick tiles). Additionally, more intricate user-facing privacy and security features are thoughtfully designed to maintain a user-friendly experience, each with its own user interface enhancements.

## **Best Practices**

**Keep the OS Up to Date** Regularly update GrapheneOS to ensure you have the latest security patches and enhancements.

**Use Strong Passwords** Set strong, unique passwords for device encryption and app logins to prevent unauthorized access.

**App Permissions** Review and manage app permissions carefully, granting only what is necessary for each app to function.

**Regular Backups** Perform regular backups of your data in case of device loss or data corruption.

**Encrypt Storage** If not enabled by default, encrypt your device’s storage to protect your data if the device is lost or stolen.

**Secure Lock Screen** Use a secure lock screen, such as a PIN, password, or biometric authentication, to prevent unauthorized access.

**Avoid Rooting Your Android Device** Avoid rooting or unlocking the bootloader, as this can weaken device security.

**Verify App Sources** Verify the authenticity of apps and their sources to avoid installing malicious software.

**Install a Privacy-Focused Browser** Consider using a privacy-focused browser like Brave browser, Firefox or Bromite for secure browsing.

**Regularly Audit Apps** Periodically review and uninstall apps that you no longer use or trust to reduce the attack surface.

**Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** Enable 2FA for your online accounts to add an extra layer of security.

**Avoid Public Wi-Fi** Be cautious when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, as they can be less secure. Use a VPN when necessary.

**Be Cautious with Location Data** Limit location tracking for apps and consider using a location spoofing tool if you value privacy.

**Avoid Unknown Links and Attachments** Be wary of unsolicited links and email attachments, as they could be phishing attempts or malware.

**Review Default Settings** Carefully review and adjust the default settings to align with your privacy preferences.

**Community Support** Engage with the GrapheneOS community and forums for tips, updates, and security advice. You can contact the team and stay updated clicking [here](https://grapheneos.org/contact) to explore more contacts.

**Use Official Installation Method** GrapheneOS offers two officially supported installation methods. Users can opt for the WebUSB-based installer, which is recommended for most individuals, or they can follow the command-line installation guide, tailored to more technically inclined users.

## **Conclusion**
