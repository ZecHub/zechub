## What is Shade Protocol?

Shade Protocol is a privacy preserving DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystem that aims to offer a suite of financial products while ensuring user privacy and security. Built on Secret Network, Shade Protocol focuses on creating a privacy centric financial environment, providing users with tools like stablecoins, synthetic assets, lending platforms, and more. The flagship product of Shade Protocol is the Silk Stablecoin, which combines privacy features with price stability.

## Technology Used by Shade Protocol

**Secret Network**

Shade Protocol is built on the Secret Network, a layer 1 blockchain that provides privacy preserving smart contracts. Secret Network uses encrypted inputs, outputs, and state to ensure transaction privacy, protecting user data from being exposed on the public ledger.

Secret Network enables developers to build decentralized applications with encrypted data, both natively on Secret and on other blockchains through cross chain communication, unlocking powerful new use cases for Web3.


**Cosmos SDK and Tendermint Core**

Cosmos was created to interconnect heterogeneous blockchains by defining better and more modern ways to build these blockchains using new tools like Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK.
The protocol uses the Cosmos SDK, a modular framework for building scalable and interoperable blockchain applications. This allows Shade Protocol to benefit from the robustness and interoperability of the Cosmos ecosystem.

For consensus and network security, Shade Protocol employs Tendermint Core, which provides Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, ensuring high security and fast finality.


**Privacy Preserving Decentralized Finance**

Privacy preserving DeFi leverages advanced cryptographic techniques like encrypted transactions, zero knowledge proofs, and private smart contracts to maintain user privacy and data confidentiality on blockchain networks. By using technologies such as Secret Network's secret contracts and Cosmos SDK for interoperability, these solutions enable confidential transactions, private asset management, and selective disclosure, ensuring financial activities remain secure and compliant with privacy regulations. This approach protects users from tracking and fraud, offering decentralized financial freedom while adhering to privacy standards.


##  Why Users May Wish to Use Shade Protocol

**Shade and Silk Tokens**

Shade Protocol utilizes viewing keys for its two main tokens: Shade ($SHD) and Silk ($SILK). Shade ($SHD) serves multiple roles, acting as the treasury, governance, and revenue sharing token within the ecosystem. It is used in staking, governance proposals, liquidity provision, transactions, and bonds. Silk ($SILK), on the other hand, is the protocol’s privacy focused stablecoin, pegged to a diverse basket of global currencies and commodities such as gold, Bitcoin, USD, Euro, and Yen.

**Privacy**

One of the main reasons users might prefer Shade Protocol is the privacy it offers. Transactions on Shade are shielded from public view, ensuring that financial data remains confidential. Unlike traditional public blockchains where transaction details are visible to all, Shade Protocol tokens utilize encrypted inputs, outputs, and states, meaning that sensitive information remains hidden from prying eyes. This enhances user privacy and security, allowing individuals to engage in financial activities without exposing their personal information or transaction history, thereby protecting against potential threats and preserving financial confidentiality.


**Stable Value**

The Silk Stablecoin provides price stability, which is crucial for users who want to avoid the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. Silk is pegged to a basket of assets, which helps maintain its value over time. Every stablecoin derives its value from a specific source, typically being pegged to the US dollar. However, this approach carries significant, often unrecognized risks. Silk mitigates these risks by maintaining stability amidst global volatility without relying on a single value peg like the US dollar. Instead, Silk's value is based on a weighted index known as the Silk Currency Basket. This basket includes a selection of global currencies (USD, CAD, EUR, JPY) and commodities such as Bitcoin and gold. By incorporating multiple currencies and assets, Silk achieves greater peg stability compared to individual currencies. Extensive research and testing have shown that gold and Bitcoin, as reliable stores of value, outperform traditional currencies, justifying their inclusion in the basket.


**Decentralization**

As a DeFi platform, Shade Protocol operates without central control, providing users with financial autonomy. Shade Protocol's decentralized governance allows its community of token holders to participate directly in the decision making process. Token holders can propose changes, vote on initiatives, and contribute to the development and direction of the protocol. This ensures that control is distributed across a diverse group of stakeholders rather than being held by a central authority. By leveraging blockchain technology, the governance process is transparent, secure, and immutable, fostering a more inclusive and resilient ecosystem.

**Interoperability**

Being part of the Cosmos ecosystem means that Shade Protocol can easily interact with other blockchains, enhancing liquidity and providing more opportunities for users to leverage their assets across different networks. By utilizing privacy preserving technologies from the Secret Network, Shade Protocol ensures that these cross chain activities maintain confidentiality and integrity. This interoperability not only enhances the flexibility and functionality of decentralized applications but also fosters a more interconnected and robust blockchain ecosystem, reducing reliance on isolated networks and promoting broader adoption of decentralized finance solutions.
