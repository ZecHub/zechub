# VPN & dVPN

In the digital age, maintaining online privacy and security is of paramount importance. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and decentralized VPNs (dVPNs) play a crucial role in safeguarding your online activities and data. This wiki page explores the key differences between traditional VPNs and emerging dVPNs, security considerations when selecting a VPN, and a list of VPN services that accept the privacy-centric cryptocurrency, Zcash.

# What's the Difference?

__Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)__: Traditional VPNs create a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server controlled by the VPN provider. This tunnel conceals your online activities from prying eyes, such as hackers, ISPs, or government agencies. VPNs are widely used for purposes like anonymous browsing, accessing geo-restricted content, and protecting against cyber threats.

__Decentralized VPNs (dVPNs)__: In contrast, dVPNs leverage blockchain and peer-to-peer technology to create a decentralized network of nodes. Users' traffic is routed through these nodes, making it difficult for any single entity to monitor or control the entire network. dVPNs are typically more resistant to censorship, as there is no centralized authority overseeing the network. They are well-suited for users seeking enhanced privacy and security.

# Security Considerations When Selecting a VPN

When choosing a VPN service, it's important to consider the following security factors:

1. __Encryption__: Ensure the VPN uses strong encryption protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard to protect your data from interception.

2. __No-Logs Policy__: Look for providers that have a strict no-logs policy, meaning they do not retain records of your online activities.

3. __Server Locations__: Consider the geographic distribution of server locations to access content from different regions and minimize latency.

4. __Kill Switch__: A kill switch will disconnect your internet if the VPN connection drops, preventing your data from being exposed.

5. __Privacy and Jurisdiction__: Research the VPN provider's privacy practices and its jurisdiction, as different countries have varying data retention laws.

6. __Leak Protection__: Ensure the VPN prevents DNS and WebRTC leaks to maintain your anonymity.

7. __Price and Features__: Evaluate the cost and features offered by different providers to find one that matches your needs and budget.

# VPNs that Accept Zcash

Zcash (ZEC) is a cryptocurrency designed for enhanced privacy, making it a favored choice for individuals seeking anonymity in their financial transactions. While not all VPN services accept Zcash directly, some may accept cryptocurrency payments through intermediary services. However, it's essential to check with the VPN provider directly for the most up-to-date payment options. Here are a few VPN services known to accept cryptocurrency payments:
