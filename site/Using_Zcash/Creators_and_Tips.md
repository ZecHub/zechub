## Why Privacy Matters for Creators
### The Problem with Traditional Crypto Tipping
When a fan sends you a tip via Bitcoin or Ethereum:
| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Transparent Balances** | Anyone can see your total earnings |
| **Transaction History** | All incoming/outgoing payments visible |
| **Supporter Exposure** | Fans' financial activity becomes linked to you |
| **Targeted Attacks** | High balances make you a target |
### The Problem with Web2 Platforms
| Platform Issue | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| **High Fees** | Patreon: 5-12%, Ko-fi: 0-5% + payment fees |
| **Deplatforming** | Accounts banned without warning |
| **Data Harvesting** | Supporter data sold or leaked |
| **Geographic Restrictions** | Services unavailable in many countries |
### The Zcash Solution
Zcash's **shielded transactions** use zero-knowledge proofs to verify payments without revealing:
- Sender address
- Receiver address  
- Transaction amount
- Wallet balance
This is battle-tested cryptography that has protected financial privacy since 2016.
