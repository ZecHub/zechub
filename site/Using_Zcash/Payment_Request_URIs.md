# Zcash Payment Request URIs

## Overview of Dynamic QR Codes

URI stands for Universal Resource Identifier. They are QR codes that act to prefill information about a transaction within a Zcash wallet. Wallets that recognize this format can construct transactions by either clicking links on web pages or scanning QR codes. Say you have an online coffee shop, your customers can make purchases by scanning these QR codes with their Zcash wallet with a prefilled price and order number.

## Use Cases of Payment Requests
