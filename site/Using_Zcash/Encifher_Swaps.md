### ðŸ”¹ Introduction  
In todayâ€™s blockchain world, privacy isnâ€™t optional â€” itâ€™s essential. With [**encrypt.trade**](https://app.encifher.io/zec), users can seamlessly swap **SOL or USDC** on Solana into **Zcash (ZEC)** while keeping transactions completely private. No centralized exchanges, no identity exposure â€” just simple, encrypted swapping.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Connect Your Solana Wallet  
Visit [encrypt.trade](https://app.encifher.io/zec) using **Chrome or Firefox**, and connect your **Phantom**, **Solflare**, or **Slope** wallet. Ensure your wallet contains enough **SOL** for gas fees and the tokens you want to trade. Once connected, youâ€™re ready to wrap your assets.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Wrap Your Tokens  
Navigate to the **Wrap** section. Choose **SOL** or **USDC**, enter the amount, and confirm. The app locks your assets and issues **encrypted versions (eSOL or eUSDC)**. To increase privacy, wrap slightly more than you plan to swap â€” this prevents one-to-one traceability.

Copy your **Unified Address** from the Receive tab â€” it supports both transparent and shielded ZEC. Save your seed phrase securely before proceeding.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Shield and Stay Private
