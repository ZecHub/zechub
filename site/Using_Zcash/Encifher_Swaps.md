###  Introduction  
In today's blockchain world, privacy isn't optional - it's essential. With [**encrypt.trade**](https://app.encifher.io/zec), users can seamlessly swap **SOL or USDC** on Solana into **Zcash (ZEC)** while keeping transactions completely private. No centralized exchanges, no identity exposure - just simple, encrypted swapping.

###  Step 1: Connect Your Solana Wallet  
Visit [encrypt.trade](https://app.encifher.io/zec) using **Chrome or Firefox**, and connect your **Phantom**, **Solflare**, or **Slope** wallet. Ensure your wallet contains enough **SOL** for gas fees and the tokens you want to trade. Once connected, you're ready to wrap your assets.

###  Step 2: Wrap Your Tokens  
Navigate to the **Wrap** section. Choose **SOL** or **USDC**, enter the amount, and confirm. The app locks your assets and issues **encrypted versions (eSOL or eUSDC)**. To increase privacy, wrap slightly more than you plan to swap - this prevents one-to-one traceability.

###  Step 3: Prepare Your Zashi Wallet  
Download [**Zashi**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dco.electriccoin.zcash%26hl%3Den%26referrer%3Dutm_source%253Dgoogle%2526utm_medium%253Dorganic%2526utm_term%253Ddownload%2Bzashi%26pcampaignid%3DAPPU_1_BU7zaJ3oL8CEhbIP373a0Qs&ved=2ahUKEwjd_p7KqK2QAxVAQkEAHd-eNroQ5YQBegQIDRAC&usg=AOvVaw2x5eoefTu-3dkuC3ujc4cn), the official Zcash wallet by Electric Coin Co. Copy your **Unified Address** from the Receive tab - it supports both transparent and shielded ZEC. Save your seed phrase securely before proceeding.

###  Step 4: Swap Privately

###  Step 5: Shield and Stay Private  
Once received, use Zashi's **Shield** option to move your ZEC into the shielded pool for maximum privacy. Always verify links, avoid reusing addresses, and test small amounts first.
