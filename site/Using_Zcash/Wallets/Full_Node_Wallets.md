# Full node Wallets

"Full nodes offer the best privacy model. If you are using a centralized wallet, you have no privacy. The wallet provider knows all of your transactions and addresses. With a full node, you download all the blockchain data and only query for addresses / transactions locally. When you have a copy of the ledger that you have validated yourself, you no longer have to trust a third party to be honest about the state of the ledger." -Jameson Lopp
