## Tracking Early On-chain & Social Signals for Zcash(ZEC)

# Introduction

This research article analyzes how early on-chain signals for Zcash, especially whale
movements and social sentiment signals on platforms like X have important implications on the
momentum of ZEC. Zcash is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency derived from Bitcoin's codebase,
with the major innovation of adding an encrypted ledger using zero-knowledge proofs.

Messari ZEC Dashboard and analyzing X discussions is one of the tools used to see if big
Zcash moves are connected to more tweets and growing interest online. Another area of
interest is how the activities of the Zcash community such as wallets, events and development
influence the movement of Zcash in the market.

According to the Messari ZEC Dashboard, CoinMetrics and Blockchair, analysis of ZEC’s
network activity provides actionable insight into whether large whale movements correspond
with spikes in social activity such as tweet volume and broader interest online. Specifically,
Messari charts reveal a clear surge in daily on-chain transaction volume and exchange inflows
during the period from July 1 to 22, 2025, peaking around July 22; coinciding with elevated
social chatter and price movement .

Blockchair data shows that the share of ZEC held in shielded addresses rose from
approximately 18 % to 20 % during the same window, indicating growing use of
privacy-preserving transactions. And then, CoinMetrics public network series confirm that daily
active addresses and shielded-supply metrics both trended upward in mid-July, enabling
quantitative comparisons between on-chain behavior and social indicators .

All these data show coin movement, privacy adoption and user engagement; the spike in large
on-chain volumes and exchange inflows that suggests whales were active, possibly relocating
funds or preparing for market impact; the increase in shielded-supply demonstrates continued
preference for privacy-enhanced transactions, even during periods of heightened attention and
the rising active address counts indicate that network usage was expanding alongside these
whale movements and privacy demand.

Past trends of ZEC are also monitored and compared to other privacy coins; how recognized
and accepted they are by different sectors and businesses help to provide context to base the
dynamics on. It is not about taking wild guesses about ZEC’s price or making effortless
predictions but analyzing signals early to show growing interest, big changes or community
activity before the wider public sees them.

Blockchain technology works in an innovative manner and the operations in cryptocurrency lead
to quite an experience. From how transactions happen to how they cause significant changes in
market behavior and sentiment, the interesting dynamics of the market can be studied; the
gains and losses being first hand experiences.

The early on-chain metrics in activity stands as one of the earliest activities and powerful metrics
that reveals the direction and movement of the market as well as the investor’s activities and
possible changes that will occur in the near future in the crypto world. Moreover, if timely
detected, these signals can help investors access profit, particularly when combined with
off-chain factors like social media sentiment analysis.



### Zcash as a privacy coin

Zcash is one of the cryptocurrencies developed with user privacy in mind which uses zero
knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) and is derived from the Bitcoin code as a fork; users can now
perform both transparent and shielded transactions. While the aim is to help protect user
privacy, having too much of it makes it harder to monitor signals that can make trading and
investing much easier. It is however not impossible.

Unlike Monero and DASH, which are often grouped as “privacy coins,
” DASH has officially
moved away from privacy coin classification following feature changes and evolving regulatory
definitions (CoinTelegraph, 2024) . ZEC still faces competition and scrutiny, but its momentum
can be measured through on-chain activity, whale movement correlation, tweet volume, and
network engagement without relying solely on price speculation.

On-chain activity refers to all the interactions that occur directly on a blockchain, such as
wallet-to-wallet transfers, token swaps, smart contract interactions, deposits and withdrawals
from exchanges, NFT minting or transfers and staking/unlocking events. Behavior patterns of
key players, especially whales, retail clusters, developers, or institutional wallets can be inferred
when this data is analyzed and it will be possible to fully understand how they relate in
determining the market.

According to the Messari ZEC Dashboard (Messari), between July 1 and July 22, 2025, there
were 12 transactions exceeding 1,000 ZEC, the largest equaling 5,200 ZEC (CoinMetrics,
2025). These capped ZEC volumes were accompanied by notable exchange inflow activity,
suggesting potential sell-off or portfolio reshuffle activity.

At the same time, shielded transactions, an essential part of Zcash’s privacy framework were
still seeing meaningful uptake. By July, about 20% of the total ZEC supply was in shielded
addresses. (Blockchair 2025) (see Figure 1)

(Source: Blockchair (2025). Shielded supply percentage from July 1–22, 2025, showing growth from
~18% to ~20%.)

Interestingly, the volume of shielded transactions went up by 8% from the previous month,
highlighting a steady demand for greater financial privacy. All in all, these trends point to a
growing privacy-driven ecosystem, where both businesses and privacy-minded users are
actively influencing how the network operates.

# Public Sentiment

The average Tweet Volume mentioning ZEC was around 450 posts a day with a peak of 1,200
on July 22, the date of the largest whale transaction. ZEC’s technical upgrades and privacy
features drew positive sentiment, as voiced by influencer accounts like @MarcoPoloMaps. This
data offers evidence that whale activity could spur online community interaction.

The privacy features and recent technical upgrades, namely the Zcash 6.2.0 protocol upgrade
and Zashi 2.0 wallet release (Zcash Foundation Blog, Electric Coin Co. Release Notes), brought
a positive sentiment to 55% of the 13,500 tweets analyzed. 30% of the tweets were neutral,
focusing on either news or tech analysis, while 15% were negative, tethered largely to the
speculative regulatory climate like the proposed privacy coin ban by the EU for 2027.

With more than 10,000 followers, accounts like @MarcoPoloMaps contributed a quarter of the
total tweet volume, and thus, were significant to the trend. As Zcash’s 6.2.0 upgrade and Zashi
2.0 release garnered attention, their discussion around these events amplified community
positivity. On-chain data supported the observed rise in user activity, with the number of daily
active addresses peaking at 3,200; a 15% increase that closely aligned with periods of
heightened whale transactions.

Other platforms like Discord, Reddit, and the Zcash Community Hub were observed to get a
sense of user sentiment and how active people were. How merchants are adopting ZEC were
checked out , especially with its use in payment solutions like Brave Wallet and Zashi. On top of
that, the project's development progress through GitHub contributions and the recent upgrades
to the network, including the Zcash v6.2.0 release was monitored.

### Correlations Between On-Chain and Social Signals

A pretty strong connection was noticed between large transactions and a spike in tweet activity.
This seems to indicate that when whales make moves, it catches a lot of people’s attention in
the market. There was also a moderate correlation showing that when social sentiment is
positive, shielded transactions tend to grow, suggesting that conversations about privacy can
really boost actual on-chain activity.

Looking at Community, Adoption, and Development, the Zcash Community Hub highlighted a
surge of grassroots excitement, with over 2,800 active members on Discord and 2,000
subscribers on Reddit. Interestingly, community engagement jumped by 12% after the launch of
Zashi 2.0, with a lot of discussions focusing on privacy innovations and how to deal with
regulatory hurdles. (See Figure 2)

2025. )

Community, Adoption, and Development in which the Zcash Community Hub showcased
growing grassroots enthusiasm. On the adoption front, merchant integration remains limited but
notable. Although usage among global merchants is low, estimated at 120, the integration of
ZEC into the Brave Wallet and the zk-proof experiment in Google Wallet in April and May 2025
respectively, boosted exposure.

The Electric Coin Company and Zcash Foundation's work showcased in the second quarter of
2025 demonstrated sustained activity. Over 350 Github commits revealed significant
collaboration on important infrastructure projects like the Zedrab codebase and Zallet wallet,
showcasing the Zcash ecosystem's active technical community.

To really analyze Zcash's current dynamics, it is best to examine the user's viewpoint over time
and compare Zcash's historical context with other privacy coins. This analysis will declare ZEC's
historical price movements, like the market high from 2017 and the block halving event of 2020,
and comparison of on-chain and social indicators with Monero (XMR) and DASH (DASH) (ex.,
transaction volume, market cap rank, and social activity).

The record high of market prices at the end of 2017 coincided with a general market surge in
the crypto markets, and Zcash's 2020 halving event was a major factor limiting ZEC supply. In
terms of some whale movement in July of 2025, it not much compared to previous market
cycles in terms of visible on-chain activity (i.e., they have obviously exchanged value, we just
can only see what they are up to through social chatter or monthly state recording). Among the
privacy coins, Monero has the edge with a vibrant user community with satisfactory daily user
interaction. Zcash is getting notice through a steep increase in shielded transactions.

# Conclusion
To bring it all together, this study shows that Zcash’s on-chain and social signals, while
sometimes subtle, reveal a dynamic and evolving ecosystem.

There are limitations; the anonymity surrounding whale wallets that makes it difficult to
determine whether or not major on-chain transactions were a market sell or simply market
moving and the shifting regulatory policy, such as the EU privacy coin ban for 2027, which may
already be affecting user sentiment; plus, the reliance on socials like X probably that does not
encapsulate the views of privacy-centered individuals, who may be inclined to choose other
anonymity-based or safe communication methods.

Zcash may not boast of a community as large as Monero or an extensive merchant base just
yet but its ongoing technical advancements, particularly with recent upgrades and vigorous
development, sets it apart. It is worthy of note that July 2025 marked a resurgence for Zcash,
sparking conversations on X with substantial whale transactions. Additionally, the consistent
increase in shielded transactions demonstrates that privacy still holds significant value for users.
There is a distinct correlation between on-chain events and social discourse, revealing how both
realms impact each other. Though navigating regulatory hurdles remains a challenge, keeping
an eye on these initial signals will enhance our understanding of ZEC's potential trajectory,
without needing to forecast prices.
