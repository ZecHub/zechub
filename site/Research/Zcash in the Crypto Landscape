Zcash role in privacy enhancement 
Since the inception of blockchain technology, it has piqued the interest of many individuals across borders, it is revolutionizing the landscape of transactions, data record keeping, and storage. Decentralization and transparency is one of its core principles. However, the main strengths that make blockchain revolutionary also present challenges, notably in combating fraud, money laundering, and much more!

Notable questions within the crypto landscape
Will cryptocurrencies be a risky investment due to their volatile nature? One major problem delaying the widespread adoption of crypto-based transactions is because of its irreversible nature which can be problematic if something goes wrong. Momentarily, ![Losing access to your wallet](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-biggest-problems-with-cryptocurrency-adoption-for-countries-and-how-can-they-be-solved?top_ans=1477743710267431) is a nightmare you wouldn’t want to get involved with; anyone looking to hold any crypto must keep multiple backups of their wallet's private keys or recovery phrases in secure locations. 
Just so you know, many governments are working tirelessly to capitalize on the technology that powers cryptocurrencies by investing in their own digital currencies - Insanely unbelievable!

Transparent and shielded blockchain transactions
![Transparent and Shielded Blockchain Transactions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GYxuvhIa1S2ZwHKZUd-qPIUVWlqyZoqP/view)
Anytime you make transactions with a transparent blockchain e.g. Ethereum or Solana, you’re revealing an individual’s data such as account balances, wallet address, spending habits, and more! On the other hand, a shielded blockchain transaction offers users the flexibility to choose when and how to reveal the transactions; transaction details like the sender, receipt, and amount can be verified as valid without revealing them on-chain.

Limitations of transparent blockchain
By revealing transaction details such as the sender, recipient, amount, and timestamp, it ensures trust among participants in the network. Following that, a transparent blockchain allows anyone to verify transactions without relying on centralized entities - this helps to eliminate the risk of fraud or manipulation within the network. Speaking of eliminating risks and fraud within blockchain networks, ![Arkham](https://www.arkhamintelligence.com/announcements/arkham-intel-exchange) is one of the AI-powered tools that systematically analyzes and deanonymizes blockchain transactions, unveiling the people and companies behind the crypto activity. Another organization that explores suspicious activity like money laundering, tracing of stolen funds, and illicit payments is ![CipherTrace](https://ciphertrace.com/).

Limitations of shielded blockchain
Shielded blockchain transactions allow for the hiding of sensitive details, and private transactions help to reduce the risk of financial fraud, identifying theft, and targeted attacks. As great as they come, privacy transactions provide a full-fledged degree of privacy compared to transparent transactions. They typically hide sensitive transaction details like the sender, recipient, timestamp, and transaction amount from the public view, thus ensuring financial privacy. In that same light, ![Christopher Goes](https://x.com/cwgoes/status/1775897996540170714?s=46&t=x0IHBx8NWn05gX8UvSlxlQ), took to his Twitter to announce that Zcash is the only privacy coin he uses nowadays due to its privacy-preserving nature.

The effects of MEV smart contract chains
Miner Extractable Value (MEV) is like an invisible tax that comes at the expense of regular users. On blockchains, some few entities run nodes called validators - validators are responsible for verifying transactions on-chain. In a transparent blockchain like Solana, 30% of validators control 33% of the network stake and could theoretically collude to halt the network. Solana’s MEV landscape is still in its infancy; the most common forms of MEV extraction are done via arbitrage, liquidations, and NFT minting.

EVM has some diverse effects on Solana, spam has plagued Solana and potentially caused numerous outages which has also led to several network outages in the past. On Solana, block production occurs every 400ms, searchers must compete over latency rather than fees, reading this state first means being the one to successfully execute a profitable trade. 

Tornado cash in the news
It is worth mentioning that while the Tornado Cash smart contract, owing its existence to the Ethereum blockchain, enhances privacy, it does not provide complete anonymity. Tornado Cash works under the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Unlike shielded blockchains, transparent Layer 1 chains will always be vulnerable to state censorship. In the block validator censorship side of things, government and centralized bodies can impose restrictions on exchanges, and mining pools, operators could also be pressured by the government to restrict certain transactions on the blockchain. Tornado Cash enables users to perform private transactions by mixing their Ethereum cryptos with others.  Due to its potential use in facilitating money laundering, and illicit activities, Tornado was sanctioned by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). While Tornado Cash is enhancing financial confidentiality,  the application can still be exploited for illicit activities. 

How Zcash is pioneering zero-knowledge cryptography?
Zcash is one of the most prominent and groundbreaking privacy-centric coins that mankind has ever witnessed. Over the last couple of years, this remarkable crypto has offered the crypto ecosystem with enhanced privacy features; more so, it is at the forefront of privacy, with Zcash privacy technology, individuals can transact anonymously while leveraging shielded addresses.
