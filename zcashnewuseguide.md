**Buy ZEC**

To use the Zcash network, you will need to purchase its currency, ZEC. The easiest way to acquire ZEC is to [buy it on Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/prices/zcash) or [any of these exchanges](https://z.cash/exchanges/).

One important note is that you do not need to buy 1 full ZEC. ZEC is divisible, and you can start with buying just a fraction of the coin.

**Setup a wallet**

After you purchase some ZEC, you might want to move it to a Zcash wallet. This [article explains](https://www.ledger.com/academy/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-why-it-matters) why holding ZEC in a wallet is important. 

We recommend using a [shielded wallet] because these wallets provide the [privacy features](https://www.gemini.com/prices/zcash) that make ZEC unique. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AefftLsENaU) on how to download a shielded walet. Here's a [video] explaining the differences between Zcash's different wallet types.
